# Sparkle
## Abstract
Sparkle (SPEECH-driven AR Key-node Live Effects) is a multi-modal real-time online speech special effects rendering software driven by speech. Unlike traditional online news broadcasts and online product introductions that use special effects subtitles, AR effects, etc., which require speakers to use a green screen environment and require support from a team that uses related software such as AE, Sparkle provides some prefabricated special effects that can be easily handled even if the entire team has only one speaker. The speaker needs to combine the content of his presentation and plan when the special effects should appear when he says what keywords (speech recognition-driven), what actions or gestures he should make (action-driven), and where he should go (location-driven). The rendering effects can also provide rich effects no less than AE post-effects through webgl technology, and the rendered bubbles/effects/subtitles can move and interact with the user's actions, speech, and gestures. Sparkle aims to free online live broadcasts or speakers from the traditional form of reading PPT/Keynote, and enable them to hold a content-rich and excellent online release event with only one person.
